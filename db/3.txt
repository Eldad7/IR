LAST night, we fled, close locked, in sweet embrace,
Across the empty kingdom men call "Space."
So deep the solitude, I could but feel
Your fear within. It made my senses reel.
I clasped you closer, with encircling arm,
As though to shield you from impending harm
And like a zephyr, from the sun-kissed South,
I felt the pressure of your trembling mouth.
 
A flame shot through my soul, in that first kiss.
I was on fire. I knew no thought but this;
I loved you--mind, heart, body, brain and soul.
And had--since centuries first began to roll.
And when your melting mouth had answered mine,
Within your eyes, a new-born light divine
Proclaimed the wondrous miracle was done,
And our two souls had melted into one.
Oh! idiot Earth, to waste the dew of youth,
Along the borderlands of perfect truth!
Oh! dolts and dullards, with your feet of clay!
To shun the glorious light of perfect day!
In that first kiss, the past was all laid bare.
The future years, transparent as the air
In swift procession, swept across our path
And left me drunk, with love's sweet aftermath.
